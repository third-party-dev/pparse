    Parser Considerations:

    It is the parser's responsibility to be lazy. The framework will allow a parser to
    attempt to scan over the data within its scope. The parser can choose to do all of
    the parsing in this phase, or ramain willfully ignorant of the data until the user
    references the data.

    It is difficult to anticipate the types of references that all interfaces would
    require. Therefore its also the parser's responsibility to implement the lookup
    API for the data within its scope. Parsers must use the framework's children member
    to advertise data that it is not willing or able to parse (e.g. another file within
    a zip container).

    It may be possible to implement an 80% solution API for referencing data in a generic
    way. The idea is that all data should be representable in a graph and you'd string
    together references to create a generic path to access any given information in the
    graph. In the generic data graph we'd have nodes that have children nodes and attributes.
    An API might resemble:

    - Node.parents() -> [Node] -> Return array of parents (strong refs).
    - Node.children() -> [weakref(Node)] -> Return array of childen (weak refs).
    - Triggers parse/load
    - Node.attributes() -> {} - Return dictionary of attributes.
    - Triggers parse/load
    - Node.child(index=-1) -> Node - Return strong ref child.
    - Triggers parse/load
    - Node.as_{bytes,i64,u64,str}() - Cast raw data as type.
    - Triggers parse/load
    - Node.loaded() - Is the data loaded and parsed?
    - Node.range() - A range of data this node covers.
    - Note: There could be situations where a conceptual "Node" is a non-continguous
            set of ranges in the data. Joining non-continguous sections of data into
            a cohesive object is not the responsibility of the parser or framework.
            That responsibility should fall to a higher level framework or code base.
    - Note: There should be nothing preventing nodes from overlapping. Its is the parsers
            responsibility to manage that situation and be aware that readahead
            optimizations will break when moving backward in memory.

    If all the child references were weakref. As long as there is a strong reference to
    the child, its path will remain.

    All nodes should be either in a loaded state or unloaded state. In the loaded state
    they are fully cached and dereference-able. In the unloaded state, the node is only
    a cursor into the data to be parsed.

    Note: When processing a large JSON object or array, all of the data needs to be
    read and parsed to know where the end of the object is and all of its immediate
    children.

    When scanning a file or Artifact, parse entire file to tracking size of:
    - What are the sizes of strings and serialized arrays of primatives?
    - What is the memory footprint of the data structure up to leaf nodes?
